# /wcg/'s next-gen pastebins

Comics we know of, all of which are named Kaito Shuno: [main.md](main.md)\
I don't care about the story as long as she draws porn: [smut.md](smut.md)

Those lists used to be hosted on [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), then [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr/).

## How to contribute

### If you can't use [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

You can edit the pastebins in your browser with GitHub's [online editor](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files). Here is how to get anonymous write access:

1. Open a GitHub account using a fake name, that is to say **choose a username that does not expose your actual identity**. Set your email address as **private** in your account's settings, so that it is not used to sign your edits.

2. Leave your (fake-name) **GitHub username** in the /wcg/ thread and ask to be added as a collaborator of this repository (direct write access) or to become a member of the organization that owns it (indirect write access). A GitHub organization is a group of GitHub accounts and our organization is called [Webcomics General](https://github.com/webcomics-general). If you're not sure, please ask to join the organization, so that you can maybe become an admin for it later.

3. You will receive an email invite from GitHub, accept it to get write access. When logged into GitHub, click on the file you want to edit in this repository, then on the pencil icon in the upper-right corner to edit it. To save your edits, click the green button that says "Commit changes".

GitHub may ask you to configure a [two-factor authentication method](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication), I'm not sure. They've been rolling it out but not every account is concerned.

### If you know your way around [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Please fork this repository and open a pull request with your changes. Alternatively, ask in the thread for write access to the repository or membership in the organization that owns it, and you will be able to push to this repository directly.

Beware not to expose your actual identity in your commits (`user.name`, `user.email`).

### In any case

The pastebins are written in Markdown (`.md` extension). It's easy:

* [Cheat sheet](https://commonmark.org/help/) and [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Hyperlinks: `[link text](https://...)`.
* Line break in paragraph: add `\` at the end of the line.
